/*Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code
Since numLegs will probably have the same value for all instances of Bird, you essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.

This may not be an issue when there are only two instances, but imagine if there are millions of instances. That would be a lot of duplicated variables.

A better way is to use the prototype of Bird. Properties in the prototype are shared among ALL instances of Bird. Here's how to add numLegs to the Bird prototype:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2;
Now all instances of Bird have the numLegs property.

console.log(duck.numLegs);
console.log(canary.numLegs);

*/

// Add a numLegs property to the prototype of Dog
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

// Only change code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
