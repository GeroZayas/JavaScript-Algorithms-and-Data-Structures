// Define a Constructor Function

/*Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. Think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

Here is an example of a constructor:

function Bird() {
  this.name = "Albert";
  this.color = "blue";
  this.numLegs = 2;
}*/

/*Create a constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs that are set to a string, a string, and a number, respectively.*/

function Dog() {
  this.name = "Yuni";
  this.color = "Black and White";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}

console.log();
