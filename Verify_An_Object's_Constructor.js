/*Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof
Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor. Here's an example:

let Bird */

let Bird = function (name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
};

let crow = new Bird("Alexis", "black");

crow instanceof Bird;
